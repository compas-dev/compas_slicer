Introduction

Overview
========

The COMPAS SLICER package broadly contains four blocks of code:

* **Geometry:** contains all geometrical entities
* **Slicers:** provides the functionality that generates the sliced model
* **Print organizers:** provides the functionality for embedding fabrication related information to the sliced model
* **Visualization:** visualizes the results in the Rhino-Grasshopper environment

Geometry
--------

The geometry part of COMPAS SLICER contains all of the geometrical entities that are specific to COMPAS SLICER: 
The ``Layer``, ``VerticalLayer``, ``Path``, and ``PrintPoint``. A ``Layer`` is essentially a single slice of the model.
In case of planar slicing, all points on one ``Layer`` are at the same height, however, this is not the case for non-planar slicing.
A ``VerticalLayer`` is a special method for organizing layers, in this case several ``Layers`` are grouped together to form a 
group of layers. The ``VerticalLayer`` is only relevant in case a model consists out of multiple ``Paths``. 
A ``Layer`` contains a list of one or mulitple ``Paths``. Multiple ``Paths`` occur when a model has multiple branches (see image). 
Each ``Path`` is a closed or open contour and contains a list of ``compas.geometry.Point`` objects. 
Lastly, the ``PrintPoint`` is essentially the same as the Points in the ``Path``, however, it contains additional fabrication parameters.

Slicers
--------

Different slicers are integrated into COMPAS SLICER.

* **Planar slicer:** Most basic slicer, slices the model through an intersection of a plane parallel to the XY plane.
* **Interpolation slicer:** Creates non-planar slices by interpolating between boundary curves.
* **Scalar field slicer:** Uses a scalar field to create non-planar slices.
* **UV slicer:** TBA.

Print organizers
----------------

After the model is sliced using one of the available slicers, the toolpath can be generated using the PrintOrganizers. 
The ``PrintOrganizer`` creates ``PrintPoint`` objects out of the ``compas.geometry.Point`` objects that are used throughout the slicing process.
Using different functions, fabrication parameters can be added or modified to the ``PrintPoints``. Examples of this include: 
setting the velocity, setting the blend radius, or adding safety printpoints (z-hop). 

Visualization
-------------

Both the Slicer output and the PrintOrganizer output can be visualized in Grasshopper. More details on this can be found in Tutorial 2.

Folder structure
================

The functions of COMPAS SLICER are grouped into different folders:

* **geometry:** Contains the main geometric classes of compas_slicer: ``Layer``, ``Path``, and ``PrintPoint``.
* **parameters:** Contains parameter presets.
* **pre_processing:** Contains various functions that are used *before slicing a model*, such as repositioning, or various operations for curved slicing.
* **slicers:** Contains the slicer classes.
* **print_organization:** Contains the print organization classes. These take a sliced model and embed on it all necessary fabrication-related information.
* **post_processing:** Contains various functions that are used *after* a model is sliced, such as different methods of sorting, or adding a brim/raft.
* **utilities:** Contains miscellaneous useful functions.
